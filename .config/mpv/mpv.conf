#
# Example mpv configuration file
#
# Warning:
#
# The commented example options usually do _not_ set the default values. Call
# mpv with --list-options to see the default values for most options. There is
# no builtin or example mpv.conf with all the defaults.
#
#
# Configuration files are read system-wide from /usr/local/etc/mpv.conf
# and per-user from ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf, where per-user settings override
# system-wide settings, all of which are overridden by the command line.
#
# Configuration file settings and the command line options use the same
# underlying mechanisms. Most options can be put into the configuration file
# by dropping the preceding '--'. See the man page for a complete list of
# options.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored.
#
# See the CONFIGURATION FILES section in the man page
# for a detailed description of the syntax.
#
# Profiles should be placed at the bottom of the configuration file to ensure
# that settings wanted as defaults are not restricted to specific profiles.
